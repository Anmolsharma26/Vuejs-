        <strong>Nako&nbsp;</strong><br />
        Nako is one of Kinnaurâ€™s most picturesque hamlets. At the commanding
        altitude of 3,662 meters, Nako village with a small lake and a highly
        revered Buddhist monastery has become very popular with tourists. A
        footprint-like impression cast on a rock is ascribed to Guru
        Padmasambhava, who is believed to have spread Buddhism to Kinnaur,
        Lahaul, Spiti and Tibet. Nako is also the base to reach Tashigang
        monastery and is the starting point for mountaineers setting out to
        scale Reo Pargial Peak. Nako is 115 km from Powari.
