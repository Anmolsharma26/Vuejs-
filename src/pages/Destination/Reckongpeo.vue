        <strong>Reckongpeo</strong><br />
        A diverging road from the Shimla-Kinnaur-Kaza highway that branches out
        from Powari, after a 7 km uphill drive gets to Reckongpeo, the district
        headquarters of Kinnaur. Peo, as it is better known, offers a
        breathtaking sight of the majestic Kinner Kailash peak (6050 m) across
        River Sutlej valley that cuts a deep gorge in between. The peak is
        believed to one of the many mythical residences of Lord Shiva in the
        Himalayas. Many pilgrims undertake a yearly trek to a 80 feet high
        vertical rock formation near the peak that is considered to be a
        ‘Shivalinga’. Where a ‘Parikrama’ (circumambulation) around the holy
        mountain base is an arduous eight-day trek, a climb to the peak is a two
        day uphill walk.
