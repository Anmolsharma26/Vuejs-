        <strong>Kamru</strong><br />
        Overlooking Sangla village stands the towering hill fort of Kamru. This
        wood and stone structure was the original seat of power of the rulers of
        Kinnaur. Kamru is a dense cluster of houses, surrounded by fields and
        orchards producing some of the finest apples of Himachal. The main
        wooden gate of the fort has the Buddha cast on it, whose blessings are
        sought before entering the village. A series of low gates in the hamlet
        lead to the fort that rises five stories high. The stronghold has an
        idol of Hindu goddess Kamakhya Devi (Kamakshi) enshrined in the upper
        storey. This idol is believed said to have been brought from Assam
        several centuries ago. The village also has a Badrinath temple.
