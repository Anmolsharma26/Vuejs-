        <strong>Kalpa</strong><br />
        Going past Reckong Peo as you ascend higher (13 km) into the hillside,
        you reach Kalpa, a beautiful hill station with some breathtaking views
        of snow peaks to soak in. The small township retains a traditional
        ambience. The finely decorated Narayan-Nagini temple is exemplary about
        the local craftsmanship, the Buddhist Hu-Bu-Lan-Kar gompa greets you
        with a white chorten and prayer wheels. Catering to the needs of many
        tourists who visit Kalpa each year, Himachal Tourism here operates Hotel
        Kinner Kailash at the hill station.
