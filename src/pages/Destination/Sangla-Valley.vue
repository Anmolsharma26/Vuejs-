        <strong>Sangla Valley</strong><br />
        Sangla is situated on the right bank of Baspa river 18 Km from Karcham
        and 38 km from Reckongpeo. The journey from Karcham onwards is enjoyable
        and adventurous throughout the valley. The natural scenery all around
        and the eternal snow view are picturesque and charming. It is also known
        as Baspa Valley since Baspa River flows through this area. This is the
        most charming valley in the entire District of Kinnaur.
