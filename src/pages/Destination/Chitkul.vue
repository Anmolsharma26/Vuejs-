        <strong>Chitkul</strong><br />
        Last inhabited village on the Indo-Tibet border, Chitkul in Baspa valley
        is 25 km from Sangla. The motorable road ends at this village and any
        further journey has to be done on foot. In the rarefied air with some
        slopes of the highlands around the village sliced into terraced fields,
        a crystal clear River Baspa flowing through bestows immense beauty on
        this habitation. Camping by the river can evoke spirituality. The
        village has nice small temple dedicated to goddess Mathi, a local deity
        sitting in its centre. Any visit to Kinnaur is incomplete without a
        visit to Chitkul.
